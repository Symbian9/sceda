          _S_c_e_d is a modeller useful for designing and previewing
          scenes for later rendering.  It supports the creation and
          editing of simple objects. Lights and cameras can be created
          and edited. Objects are created by instancing a basic object
          type. New types may be created through Constructive Solid
          Geometry (CSG) or by loading an externally defined
          wireframe.

          The program provides an iteractive interface where appropri-
          ate. In particular, objects are placed and edited with the
          aid of interactive constraints.  The constraints allow for
          the rapid arrangement of objects in relation to other
          objects in the scene, or arbitrary points. An interactive
          interface is also provided for dynamically adjusting the
          view of the scene presented by the program.

          Sced currently exports scenes to POVray, Rayshade, Radiance,
          RenderMan, Genray and Genscan.

          For full documentation see the user's guide distributed with
          the program.

          -F filename
               Load the specified filename on startup.

          -D defaults
               Use default values found in the given file. If this
               option is not present the program will look for a file
               called .scenerc in the user's home directory. Failing
               this, internal defaults will be used. The format for
               the defaults file is described in the User's Guide.

          -I WidthxHeight
               Use an editing window of the given size. This does not
               effect the size of the programs window (use -geom),
               rather it determines the size of the scrollable window
               in which the scene appears.
