       1.  _C_S_G__M_U_G__T_U_T_O_R_I_A_L

       This tutorial is intended to introduce the CSG interface. It
       assumes knowledge of the editing interface provided by
       starting.tut and block_world.tut.

       The aim is to create a Mug, or Coffee cup, out of a few
       cylinder and cropping cubes.

       Be aware that saving does NOT save the objects in the CSG
       window, only completed CSG objects. It really should save
       such objects, but it's a fair bit of code to write and I'm
       not interested at the moment (there are more important
       things to do).

         1.  Start it up.  We'll start by positioning the objects
             in the Scene Window, then shifting them to the CSG
             Window for combining. This allows the objects to be
             saved in position. Constraints between objects which
             are transferred to the CSG Window in one action are
             kept intact, but other constraints are converted to
             non-references. All this means is that CSG objects
             should be designed and constrained in terms of their
             constituent objects, not other objects in the scene.

         2.  Create a cylinder, place it in the middle of the scene
             and uniformly scale it to a reasonable size (about 3x
             its initial size). That means use the Uniform scaling
             constraint provided.

         3.  Make its wireframe dense. Select the cylinder and
             choose Dense Wire from the object menu.

         4.  Create another cylinder. This one will be subtracted
             from the first to create the cup bit. Edit it too. Put
             the Origin at the center of the base. Use combined Y-Z
             and Z-X planes to move it down so that there is the
             appropriate base thickness between the 2 cylinders.
             Change the view around to let you judge this
             accurately.

         5.  - Scale the second cylinder. We'll do this a smart
             way. Use a line constraint across the top of the outer
             cylinder, so that the Scaling Point snaps to the right
             height and the radius can be adjusted to fit. So
             choose Add Line from the Scale box, and select 2
             points, one on the outer cylinder at the vertex
             corresponding to the Scaling Point on the inner
             cylinder, and the point diagonally opposite it, so the
             line passes through the center of the top of the outer
             cylinder and the inner cylinder will scale straight up

             to meet it.

         6.  Select the Scale constraint you just added. The inner
             cylinder will snap up to the same level as the outer
             one. The base stays where it is because the Origin is
             at the base. Adjust the radius of the inner cylinder
             by dragging the Scaling Point along the constraint
             line until you are happy with it.

         7.  Make the inner cylinder dense too.

         8.  That's the basis for a mug. Select both cylinders and
             click on the CSG Window button. Another window will
             pop up, the CSG window. In the region at the bottom,
             the Tree Window, there are 2 buttons, one for each
             cylinder. Each has a menu attached to it. Have a look
             but don't select anything. Well, actually, select
             Display for each. The cylinders will appear in the
             window above.

         9.  You want to combine them by taking the inner one away
             from the outer.  Choose Attach from the Cylinder_1
             menu (the inner cylinder). A little rectangle will
             follow the cursor around. Go to the Cylinder_0 menu,
             and you'll see it now has the CSG operations on it and
             Cancel. Choose Difference. The 2 nodes should now for
             a tree, with a - as the internal node. The RIGHT node
             is subtracted from the LEFT node. If you wish to
             reverse the order, choose ReOrder from the menu on the
             "-" node.

        10.  Complete this part of the object. Choose Complete off
             the "-" node.  You will be prompted for a name.
             Instances will have a default name based on this. In
             this case try MugBase.

        11.  You will then be presented with a wireframe for the
             object, and asked to choose a Scaling Point. Choose
             the vertex that you want as the default scaling point.
             You can always change it later, but you'll have to
             change it for each instance individually.

        12.  Now for the handle. Create a cylinder and a cube,
             using New Object in the CSG Window (NOT the Scene
             Window). the new objects appear down the bottom, but
             aren't displayed.

        13.  Display the cylinder and edit it. Same procedure for
             editing any object. Rotate it 90degrees until it's
             axis lines up with the X-axis.  Select the Minor Axis
             Rotate constraint and use Temp Allign off the Major

             menu to do this.

        14.  - Scale it to a bigger radius. Add a Scaling Line
             Scaling constraint which goes from the Scaling Point
             through the center of that endcap. That is, choose the
             center of the endcap as the point defining the line.
             Use reference (button 1) points to specify the line.
             Call it ConstRadius, because this will scale while
             keeping it round. Scale it out to be about 2x its old
             size.

        15.  Copy the cylinder. Use Copy on its menu at the bottom
             (there's no copy or delete on the Object menu for
             CSG). The new one won't be displayed and when you
             display it, it will appear on top of the original one,
             so you won't be able to tell them apart. The best way
             to solve this problem is to Un-Display the one you
             don't want.

        16.  Edit the new cylinder (or the old one, it doesn't
             matter, as long as you know which is inside the
             other). Make it a bit smaller than the other one -
             with the difference between them sort of handle width.

        17.  Display and edit the cube. There are a few ways to do
             this but we'll use intersection. Position the cube so
             that one side is on the Z-axis.  The best way is to
             Add a Line Position constraint which corresponds to
             the Z-axis. Then move the origin to the back face of
             the Cube and select the constraint.

        18.  Scale the cube to make it higher than the cylinders
             and handle thickness.  Use the default constraints to
             scale in the appropriate directions. The Origin will
             stay where you put it. Finish when it looks right.
             Make sure all the parts of the cylinders you want to
             keep are inside the Cube.

        19.  Build the tree. Attach the inner cylinder to the outer
             one using Attach then Difference. Then attach the Cube
             to the "-" node using an Intersection. The tree should
             look like: (The names might be different).

             Cylinder_2  Cylinder_2_4

        20.  Complete it, and call it a Handle.

        21.  To build the mug we attach a base to a handle. Go to
             New Object (CSG), click on New CSG Object (now
             available), and choose a base. Do it again to choose a
             handle.

        22.  Display both objects, and Edit the Handle. We want the
             handle to attach on one side (obviously) but sticking
             into the base so that the square ends are hidden
             inside the wall. Use a Line Position constraint, with
             the line being one of the vertical generators for the
             inner cylinder. Preferable the one at the positive end
             of the Y-Axis, since this will give the right
             orientation. Notice that the Origin for the Handle is
             where the origin of the CSG window was when the object
             was created. This suits us just fine. Add the
             constraint and select it. Finish for a moment.

        23.  The handle looks a bit round, so we'll shear it a bit
             to give it a sort of elliptical look.  It's not
             terribly obvious how to set the Object Axes up to get
             the shear you want, but here's a rough idea. You don't
             want it to shear sideways, so leave one axis parallel
             to the axis of the cylinders that make up the handle.
             that's the Minor Axis. Change the Major axis to point
             toward the top of the Z-Axis. Choose "Redefine 1" off
             the Major menu and select the top of the Z-axis. This
             will screw up the Minor axis again, so choose
             "Redefine 2" off the Minor menu and select both
             endpoints of the X-axis. You should have the Minor
             axis where it started, parallel to the X-axis, and the
             Major and Other axes leaning over.

        24.  Use Major-Other Pl to scale it so that the amount of
             shear looks like a handle. Don't worry that it's no
             longer vertical - that can be fixed.

        25.  Fix the vertical allignment. Change the Axes again.
             Use "Redefine 2" Major to reallign the Major axis with
             one of the edges you want vertical.  Use "Redefine 2"
             Minor to allign Minor with one of the edges you want











                                  - 5 -



             horizontal. Then, use allignment constraints to get it
             alligned the way you want.

        26.  The handle should fit nicely. If it's too big or
             small, use the scaling constraints to reshape it. Now
             that the Axes are vertical and horizontal again you
             won't shear it.

        27.  Attach the handle to the base in a Union.

        28.  Preview the mug, by choosing a good view, then
             selecting Preview off the menu on the Union sign.
             Select a raytracer and watch it happen.

        29.  All that remains is to attach the handle to the base
             with a Union, and complete it. Call it Mug, or
             whatever you prefer, and select a default Scaling.

        30.  Close the CSG window - CSG menu, Close option.

        31.  Back in the scene window, before creating any
             instances, save what you have as mug.base. The file is
             now suitable for merging whenever you want a mug!

        32.  And create an instance to have a look at it. Just go
             New Object - New CSG Object and choose it.

       From here the mug can be rendered or included in other
       scenes.
